<span class="paragraph">Abstract.</span>  
This short note describes a simple approach for aggregating many
BLS signatures on a common message, so that verifying the short
multi-signature is fast.  
Moreover, the system supports public key aggregation,
where the verification algorithm only uses a short aggregated public key.  
The original public keys are not needed for verifying the
multi-signature. 
An important property of the construction is that the scheme is secure 
against a rogue public-key attack <i>without</i> requiring users to 
prove knowledge of their secret keys (this is sometimes called
the plain public-key model).
The construction builds upon the work of Bellare and Neven,
and the recent work of Maxwell, Poelstra, Seurin, and Wuille.

<h2>1. BLS signature aggregation </h2>

<p>
The BLS signature scheme [<a class='cite' href='#BLS01'>BLS01</a>] operates in a prime order group and supports
simple threshold signature generation, threshold key generation,
and signature aggregation [<a class='cite' href='#BGLS03'>BGLS03</a>].  To review, the scheme
uses the following ingredients:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
a <b>bilinear pairing</b>
$e:\G_0 \times \G_1 \to \G_T$.
The pairing is efficiently computable, 
non-degenerate, and all three groups have prime order $q$.
We let $g_0$ and $g_1$ be generators of $\G_0$ and $\G_1$ respectively.
</li>

<li style="margin-top:1em">
a <b>hash function</b>
$\Hm: \MM \to \G_0$.  The hash function will be treated as a random oracle in the security
analysis. 
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Now the BLS signature scheme is defined as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
$\textbf{KeyGen}()$: &nbsp;
choose a random $\alpha \rgets \Z_q$ and set $h \gets g_1^\alpha \in \G_1$.
output $\PK \deq (h)$ and $\SK \deq (\alpha)$.
</li>

<li style="margin-top:1em">
$\textbf{Sign}(\SK, m)$: &nbsp;
output $\sigma \gets \Hm(m)^\alpha \in \G_0$.
The signature is a <i>single</i> group element. 
</li>

<li style="margin-top:1em">
$\textbf{Verify}(\PK,m,\sigma)$: &nbsp;
if $e(g_1, \sigma) = e\big(\PK,\ \Hm(m)\big)$ &nbsp; output "accept",
otherwise output "reject".
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Signature aggregation.</b>
Given triples $(\PK_i,\ m_i,\ \sigma_i)$ for $i=1,\ldots,n$,
anyone can aggregate the signatures $\sigma_1,\ldots,\sigma_n \in \G_0$ 
into a short convincing
aggregate signature $\sigma$ by computing
\begin{equation} \label{eq:agg}
  \sigma \gets \sigma_1 \cdots \sigma_n \in \G_0.  
\end{equation}
Verifying an aggregate signature $\sigma \in \G_0$ is done by checking that
\begin{equation} \label{eq:aggdiff}
  e(g_1, \sigma) = e\big(\PK_1,\ \Hm(m_1)\big) \cdots e\big(\PK_n,\ \Hm(m_n)\big).
\end{equation}
When all the messages are the same ($m_1 = \ldots = m_n$)
the verification relation \eqref{eq:aggdiff} reduces to a simpler
test that requires only two pairings: 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:aggsame}
  e(g_1, \sigma) = e\Big(\PK_1 \cdots \PK_n,\ \Hm(m_1)\Big).
\end{equation}
</p>

<p>
<b>The rogue public-key attack.</b>
This signature aggregation method \eqref{eq:agg} is insecure by itself due to
a rogue public-key attack, 
where an attacker registers the 
public key $\PK_2 \deq g_1^\beta \cdot (\PK_1)^{-1} \in \G_1$,
where $\PK_1 \in \G_1$ is a public key of some unsuspecting user Bob,
and $\beta \rgets \Z_q$ is chosen by the attacker. 
The attacker can then claim that both it and Bob signed 
some message $m \in \MM$
by presenting the aggregate signature
$  \sigma \deq \Hm(m)^\beta.  $
This signature verifies as an aggregate of two signatures, one from 
$\PK_1$ and one from $\PK_2$, because
\[  e(g_1,\sigma) = e\big(g_1,\ \Hm(m)^\beta \big) =  
			e\big(g_1^\beta,\ \Hm(m)\big) =  
			e\big(\PK_1 \cdot \PK_2,\ \Hm(m)\big). \] 
Hence, this $\sigma$ satisfies \eqref{eq:aggsame}.
In effect, the attacker committed Bob to the message $m$, without Bob ever
signing $m$.

<p style="margin-bottom:0.2em">
<b>Defenses.</b>
There are two standard defenses against the rogue public-key attack:
</p>
<ul style="margin-top:0em">
<li class="algbullet"> 
<b>Prove knowledge of the secret key (KOSK)</b> [<a class='cite' href='#Bol03'>Bol03</a>, <a class='cite' href='#LOS06'>LOS06</a>, <a class='cite' href='#RY07'>RY07</a>]:  <br/>
Require every user that registers a public key to prove knowledge
of the corresponding secret key.  However, this is difficult
to enforce in practice, and does not fit well with 
applications to crypto currencies [<a class='cite' href='#MPSW18'>MPSW18</a>].
</li>

<li class="algbullet"> 
<b>Distinct messages</b> [<a class='cite' href='#BGLS03'>BGLS03</a>, <a class='cite' href='#BNN07'>BNN07</a>]:  <br/>
Alternatively, require that all the messages being aggregated are distinct.
This can be easily enforced by always prepending the public key
to every message prior to signing. 
However, because now all messages are distinct, we cannot take
advantage of the efficiency improvement in \eqref{eq:aggsame}
that apply when aggregating signatures on a common message $m$. 
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>This work.</b>
In this short note we propose a third defense against
the rogue public-key attack that retains
the benefits of both defenses above, without the drawbacks.
The scheme supports fast verification as in \eqref{eq:aggsame}
and does not require users to prove knowledge of their secret key. 
Our construction is based on the approach developed 
in [<a class='cite' href='#BN06'>BN06</a>] and [<a class='cite' href='#MPSW18'>MPSW18</a>] for securing Schnorr multi-signatures.
</p>

<p>
We first describe the scheme and then describe its applications
and security proof.
</p>



<h2>2. The modified BLS multi-signature construction</h2>

<p>
As in BLS, the scheme needs a bilinear pairing 
$e:\G_0 \times \G_1 \to \G_T$
and a hash function $\Hm: \MM \to \G_0$.
We will also need a second hash function $\Hpk$:
\[ \Hpk: \G_1^n \to R^n \qquad\text{where}\qquad
   R \deq \{1,2,\ldots,2^{128}\}  \]
and where $1 \le n \le \tilde{N}$.
The security analysis will treat $\Hm$ and $\Hpk$ as random oracles. 
With these ingredients, the modified BLS multi-signature 
scheme works as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
$\textbf{KeyGen}()$:
as in BLS, choose a random $\alpha \rgets \Z_q$ and set $h \gets g_1^\alpha$.
output $\PK \deq (h)$ and $\SK \deq (\alpha)$.
</li>

<li style="margin-top:1em">
$\textbf{Sign}(\SK, m)$:
as in BLS, output $\sigma \gets \Hm(m)^\alpha \in \G_0$.
</li>

<li style="margin-top:1em">
$\textbf{Aggregate}\Big((\PK_1, \sigma_1),\ldots,(\PK_n, \sigma_n)\Big)$:
<ol>
<li class="algbullet"> compute $(t_1,\ldots,t_n) \gets \Hpk(\PK_1,\ldots,\PK_n) \in R^n$.</li>
<li class="algbullet"> output the multi-signature $\sigma \gets \sigma_1^{t_1} \cdots \sigma_n^{t_n} \in \G_0$.</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li style="margin-top:1em">
$\textbf{Verify}\big(\PK_1,\ldots,\PK_n,\ m,\ \sigma\big)$:
to verify a multi-signature $\sigma$ on $m$ do
<ol>
<li class="algbullet"> compute $(t_1,\ldots,t_n) \gets \Hpk(\PK_1,\ldots,\PK_n) \in R^n$.</li>
<li class="algbullet"> compute the aggregate public key $\APK \gets \PK_1^{t_1} \cdots \PK_n^{t_n} \in \G_1$.</li>
<li class="algbullet"> if $e(g_1,\sigma) = e(\APK,\Hm(m))$ output "accept",
otherwise output "reject".</li>
</ol>
<p style="margin-top:0.2em">
Verification always requires two pairings, independent of $n$.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Notice that the aggregate public key $\APK$ 
can be computed in step (2) of Verify
before the message $m$ is known.
In particular, verifying the multi-signature $\sigma$ is the same as
verifying that $\sigma$ is a standard BLS signature on $m$ with respect to
the aggregated public key $\APK$.  
Once $\APK$ is computed, there is no need to provide the verifier
with the underlying public keys $\PK_1,\ldots,\PK_n$. 
This mechanism is called <i>public key aggregation</i>.
We prove security of this scheme in Section 3. 
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0em">
<b>Batch verification.</b>
A set of $b$ multi-signatures can be verified as a batch faster than
verifying them one by one. 
To see how, suppose we are given triples $(m_i, \sigma_i, \APK_i)$
for $i=1,\ldots,b$, where $\APK_i$ is the aggregated
public-key used to verify the multi-signature $\sigma_i$ on $m_i$. 
If all the messages $m_1,\ldots,m_b$ are distinct then we
can use signature aggregation as in \eqref{eq:agg}
to verify all these triples as a batch:
</p>
<ol style="margin:0.5em 0em">
<li class="algbullet">
Compute an aggregate signature
$\tilde{\sigma} = \sigma_1 \cdots \sigma_b \in \G_1$,
</li>

<li class="algbullet">
Accept all $b$ multi-signature tuples as valid iff
$\ \   e(g_1, \tilde{\sigma}) = e\big(\APK_1,\Hm(m_1)\big) \cdots e\big(\APK_b,\Hm(m_b)\big). $
</li>
</ol>
<p style="margin-top:0em">
This way, verifying the $b$ multi-signatures requires only $b+1$ pairings
instead of $2b$ pairings to verify them one by one.  
We stress that this simple batching procedure can only be used when
all the messages $m_1,\ldots,m_b$ are distinct.  
If some messages are repeated then batch verification can be done by 
first choosing random $\rho_1,\ldots,\rho_b \rgets \{1,\ldots,2^{64}\}$,
computing 
$\tilde{\sigma} = \sigma_1^{\rho_1} \cdots \sigma_b^{\rho_b} \in \G_1$,
and checking that 
\[   e(g_1, \tilde{\sigma}) = e\big(\APK_1^{\rho_1},\Hm(m_1)\big) \cdots e\big(\APK_b^{\rho_b},\Hm(m_b)\big).  \]
Of course the pairings on the right hand side can be coalesced for repeated
messages. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Comparison to Schnorr multi-signatures.</b>
Schnorr signatures support multi-signatures [<a class='cite' href='#IN83'>IN83</a>, <a class='cite' href='#MOR01'>MOR01</a>, <a class='cite' href='#BN06'>BN06</a>, <a class='cite' href='#MPSW18'>MPSW18</a>],
however, aggregation can only take place at the time of signing
and requires a multi-round protocol between the signers. 
In BLS, aggregation can take place publicly by a simple multiplication,
even long after all the signatures
have been generated and the signers are no longer available. 
</p>


<h3>2.1 Application to crypto currencies such as Bitcoin</h3>

Maxwell et al. [<a class='cite' href='#MPSW18'>MPSW18</a>] 
describe a number of important applications
for multi-signatures to crypto currencies such as Bitcoin. 
<ul>
<li>
<b>Multisig addresses.</b>
In current Bitcoin, to spend from a $t$-of-$n$ multisig address 
one must list all $n$ public keys and $t$ signatures in the spending 
transaction.
Usually all $t$ signatures are computed over a common message, 
namely the spending transaction data. 
When using BLS multi-signatures, anyone can aggregate all $t$
signatures into a single aggregate signature and shrink the
spending transaction size.  
If a user does not aggregate the signatures, the miner mining the
transaction can do it on their behalf. 

<p class="algbullet">
Moreover, in the case of $n$-of-$n$ multisig, one can further aggregate
all $n$ public keys into a single aggregate public key that is
used to derive the multisig address.  
When spending from the address, one need only specify the 
aggregate public key, which further shrinks the transaction size. 
</p>

<p class="algbullet">
For $t$-of-$n$ multisig, where ${n \choose t}$ is of moderate size,
one can generate a Merkle tree from all ${n \choose t}$ aggregate public keys,
and derive the multisig address from the short Merkle root.
When spending from the multisig address, 
one provides a single aggregate signature,
along with the single aggregate public key $\APK$ of the $t$ signers,
and the Merkle proof for this $\APK$. 
In the <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/483.pdf">full paper</a> 
(Section 4.2)
we present a construction that can handle $t$-of-$n$ multisig 
even when ${n \choose t}$ is large.
</p>
</li>

<li style="margin-top:1em">
<b>Multi-input transactions.</b>
For transactions that have multiple inputs, one currently includes
all the signatures in the transaction.  One can set things
up so that all signatures
are computed over the same message, namely the transaction data
(see [<a class='cite' href='#MPSW18'>MPSW18</a>] for the details).
When using BLS multi-signatures, anyone can aggregate all these
signatures into a single multi-signature. 
If the user does not aggregate, the miner who mines the transaction
can do it for her.
This may be convenient when constructing a CoinJoin transaction.  
 </li>
</ul>

<p>
In all cases above, miners can choose to further aggregate signatures
across different transactions using the standard BLS signature aggregation
mechanism in \eqref{eq:agg}.  
This will further shrink the block size. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Compatibility with transaction validation caching.</b>
Recall that transaction validation caching is a process whereby
a node validates transactions as they are added to the node's mempool
and marks them as validated.  
When a previously validated transaction appears in a new block,
the node need not re-validate the transaction. 
Transaction validation caching is compatible with signature
aggregation across multiple transactions in a block.  
To see why, consider a node that receives a new block containing an
aggregate signature $\sigma = \sigma_1 \cdots \sigma_n$,
aggregated over $n$ transactions in the block.  
The node can identify all the transactions in this new block
that are already marked as validated in its mempool, and 
divide $\sigma$ by the signatures associated with these 
pre-validated transactions.
Effectively, the pre-validated signatures are removed from the
aggregate signature $\sigma$.   
Let $\sigma'$ be the resulting aggregate signature.
Now the node need only check that $\sigma'$ is a valid
aggregate signature over the remaining transactions in the block, 
namely those transactions that are not already in its mempool.
</p>


<h2>3. Proving security</h2>

<p>
Security for a multi-signature scheme is defined using 
the following game between a challenger and an adversary $\adv$.
</p>
<ol>
<li class="algbullet"> <b>Setup</b>. 
The challenger runs KeyGen to generate
a key pair $\PK, \SK$ and sends $\PK$ to the adversary. </li>

<li class="algbullet"> <b>Signature queries</b>. 
The adversary issues adaptive chosen message queries
$m_1, m_2, \ldots \in \MM$ and receives back the
signatures $\sigma_i = \text{Sign}(\SK,m_i)$ for $i=1,2,\ldots$
from the challenger. </li>

<li class="algbullet"> <b>Forgery</b>.
Eventually, the adversary outputs a forgery:
it outputs public keys $\PK_1,\ldots,\PK_n$, a message $m \in \MM$,
and a multi-signature $\sigma$. </li>
</ol>
<p style="margin-top:0em">
The adversary wins the game if 
it did not issue a signature query for $m$ and 
$\text{Verify}(\PK, \PK_1,\ldots,\PK_n, m, \sigma)$ outputs "accept".
We could allow the challenge $\PK$ to appear anywhere in the tuple of
public keys given to $\text{Verify}$, 
but to simplify the notation we require that it be the left most element. 
The same analysis applies if we allow $\PK$ to appear elsewhere.
We use
\[  \text{SIGadv}[\adv, {\cal S};\ \qsig, \qHm, \qHpk]  \]
to denote the adversary's advantage in attacking the scheme ${\cal S}$,
for an adversary that makes 
at most $\qsig$ signature queries,
at most $\qHm$ queries to $\Hm$, and
at most $\qHpk$ queries to $\Hpk$.
We say that the scheme ${\cal S}$ is secure if for all efficient adversaries 
the advantage is negligible.
</p>

<p>
<b>The co-CDH assumption</b>.
Security of the scheme ${\cal S}$ from Section 2 
relies on the standard co-CDH assumption in the 
bilinear group $(\G_0,\G_1)$.
The assumption states that for all efficient algorithms $\adv$ 
the quantity
\[  \text{CDHadv}[\adv, (\G_0,\G_1)] \deq
	\Pr\Big[ \adv(g_1^\alpha,\ g_0^\beta,\ g_0^\alpha) = g_0^{\alpha \beta} \Big]
        
\]
is negligible, where $\alpha, \beta \rgets \Z_q$. 
</p>



<h3>3.1 Proving security of multi-sig BLS</h3>

<p>We prove security of the scheme ${\cal S}$ from Section 2 without
requiring signers to prove knowledge of their secret key.
We will prove security of a slightly modified scheme ${\cal S}'$.
The only difference is that there is an additional element in the public key.
Specifically, key generation in ${\cal S}'$ outputs
$\PK = (g_1^\alpha, g_0^\alpha)$.  
However, in the security game, when the adversary outputs the
final forgery, which includes a list of public keys,
it only needs to output the left term of each public key, 
as when attacking ${\cal S}$. 
Clearly if ${\cal S}'$ is secure then so is ${\cal S}$. 
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0px">
The proof is done in three short steps, captured in the following
three theorems:
</p>
<ol style="margin:0px">
<li class="algbullet">We show that a general attacker $\adv_1$ on ${\cal S}'$ gives
an attacker $\adv_2$ on ${\cal S}'$ that makes no chosen message queries.</li>

<li class="algbullet">we show that an attacker $\adv_2$ on ${\cal S}'$ that makes no chosen
message queries but potentially many queries to $\Hpk$, gives
an attacker $\adv_3$ on ${\cal S}'$ that makes only one query to $\Hpk$.</li>

<li class="algbullet">we show than an attacker $\adv_3$ on ${\cal S}'$ that makes no chosen
message queries and only one query to $\Hpk$, can be used to break co-CDH.</li>
</ol>
<p style="margin-top:0.4em">
Putting these three steps together proves security of ${\cal S}'$ 
and therefore of ${\cal S}$.  The third step is the most interesting
so we present that step first, then the second step, and finally
the general result in the first step. 
</p>

<div class="theorem">
<p>
<b>Theorem 1:</b>
Let $\adv$ be an adversary attacking ${\cal S}'$ 
that makes no chosen message queries and at most one query to $\Hpk$.
Let 
\[  \epsilon = \text{SIGadv}[\adv, {\cal S}';\ 0, \qHm, 1] \]
be its advantage.
Then there exists an adversary $\bdv$ for computing co-CDH,
whose running time is about twice that of $\adv$, 
with advantage $\epsilon' = \text{CDHadv}[\bdv, (\G_0,\G_1)]$
such that
\[   \epsilon' \geq \epsilon^2 - \epsilon/N.  \]
Here $N = \abs{R}$, the size of one coordinate in the image of $\Hpk$.
This implies
\[   \epsilon \leq (1/N) + \sqrt{\epsilon'}.   \]
</p>
</div>
<p style="margin-bottom:0px">
<b>Proof.</b>
Algorithm $\bdv$ is a given a co-CDH instance 
$(h = g_1^\alpha,\ u = g_0^\beta,\ \hat{h} = g_0^\alpha) \in \G_1 \times G_0^2$.
It needs to compute $g_0^{\alpha \beta}$. 
Algorithm $\bdv$ runs $\adv$ and gives it the public key $\PK = (h,\hat{h})$.
Now $\adv$ can issue many queries to $\Hm$ and a single query to $\Hpk$.
For $i=1,2,\ldots$ algorithm $\bdv$ responds to query number $i$ as follows:
</p>
<ul style="margin:0px">
<li class="algbullet">
$\bdv$ responds to a query for $\Hm(m_i)$, where $m_i \in \MM$, 
by choosing a random $\rho_i \rgets \Z_q$
and setting $\Hm(m_i) \gets u^{\rho_i}$. </li>

<li class="algbullet">
$\bdv$ responds to a (single) query for $\Hpk(h_0,h_1,\ldots,h_n)$,
where $(h_0, \ldots, h_n) \in G_1^{n+1}$,
by choosing a random $(t_0, \ldots, t_n) \rgets R^{n+1}$ and
setting $\Hpk(h_0,h_1,\ldots,h_n) \gets (t_0,\ldots,t_n)$.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Suppose that eventually $\adv$ outputs a valid forgery.
We can assume that the public keys in the forgery are the public keys
in the query to $\Hpk$, since otherwise the forgery cannot be valid. 
In other words, the forgery is a tuple $(h_1,\ldots,h_n,m,\sigma)$
such that
\[ e(g_1,\sigma) = e\left(h^{t_0} h_1^{t_1} \cdots h_n^{t_n},\ \Hm(m) \right). \]
Moreover, $\bdv$ knows a $\rho \in \Z_q$ such that $\Hm(m) = u^\rho$
and therefore
\begin{equation} \label{eq:forge1}
 e(g_1,\sigma) = e\left(h^{t_0} h_1^{t_1} \cdots h_n^{t_n},\ u^\rho \right)
   = e(h,u)^{t_0 \rho} \cdot e\left(h_1^{t_1} \cdots h_n^{t_n},\ u \right)^\rho. 
\end{equation}
</p>

<p>
Next, $\bdv$ rewinds $\adv$ to the point where it issued the query to 
$\Hpk(h, h_1, \ldots, h_n)$.  
This time algorithm $\bdv$ responds by choosing a fresh $t_0' \rgets R$ 
and sets
\[  \Hpk(h,h_1,\ldots,h_n) \gets (t_0',t_1,\ldots,t_n).  \]
Suppose that again $\adv$ outputs a valid forgery $(h_1,\ldots,h_n,m',\sigma')$.
As before, $\bdv$ has $\rho' \in \Z_q$ such that $\Hm(m') = u^{\rho'}$
and
\begin{equation} \label{eq:forge2}
e(g_1,\sigma') = e\left(h^{t_0'} h_1^{t_1} \cdots h_n^{t_n},\ u^{\rho'} \right) =
e(h,u)^{t_0 \rho'} \cdot e\left(h_1^{t_1} \cdots h_n^{t_n},\ u \right)^{\rho'}.
\end{equation}
</p>

<p>
Then raising equation \eqref{eq:forge2} to the power of $\rho$
and dividing by equation \eqref{eq:forge1} 
raised to the power of $\rho'$ leads to
\[ e\left(g_1,\ (\sigma')^\rho/\sigma^{\rho'}\right) = e(h, u)^{\rho \rho' (t_0' - t_0)}.  \]
Let us assume that $t_0 \neq t_0'$. 
Now, because $e(h,u) = e(g_1,g_0^{\alpha \beta})$ it follows that 
\[  g_0^{\alpha \beta} = \left((\sigma')^\rho/\sigma^{\rho'}\right)^{1/\rho \rho' (t_0' - t_0)}.  \]
which is the solution to the given co-CDH challenge.
</p>

We see that $\bdv$ solves the given co-CDH instance
whenever $t_0 \neq t_0'$
and $\adv$ outputs a valid forgery
in both runs, so that both \eqref{eq:forge1} and \eqref{eq:forge2} hold.
To calculate the probability that this happens
we use the following simple lemma, called the <i>rewinding lemma</i>
(a variant of Lemma 19.2 in the <a href="http://cryptobook.us">cryptography book</a>).
</p>

<p>
<b><a href="https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/cryptobook/BonehShoup_0_4.pdf#page=661">Rewinding lemma</a>:</b>
Let $S, R$, and $T$ be finite, non-empty sets,
and let $f : S \times R \times T \rightarrow \{ 0, 1\}$ be a function.
Let $X$ and $Y, Y'$ and $Z, Z'$ be mutually independent random variables,
where $X$ takes values in the set $S$, 
the variables $Y$ and $Y'$ are each uniformly distributed over $R$, 
and $Z$ and $Z'$ take values in the set $T$.
Let $\epsilon \deq \Pr[f(X,Y,Z) = 1]$ and $N \deq \abs{R}$.
Then 
\[
\Pr\Big[ f(X,Y,Z) = 1 \xwedge f(X,Y',Z') = 1 \xwedge Y \ne Y' \Big] \ge \epsilon^2 - \epsilon/N . 
\]
</p>

<p>To apply the lemma, let $X$ be all the quantities
given to $\adv$ 
up to and including the query to $\Hpk$ and its response, excluding $t_0$.
Let $Y$ and $Y'$ be $t_0$ and $t_0'$, respectively.
Let $Z$ be all the quantities given to $\adv$ 
in the first run following the query to $\Hpk$.  
Similarly, let $Z'$ be all the quantities given to $\adv$
in the second run following the query to $\Hpk$. 
Then $(X,Y,Z)$ are the random values given to $\adv$ in the first run,
and $(X,Y',Z')$ are the random values given to $\adv$ in the second run. 
The function $f(X,Y,Z)$ is $1$ whenever $\adv$ produces a valid forgery
given the quantities $X,Y,Z.$
The rewinding lemma now gives the bounds stated in the theorem, 
and completes the proof.

<b>Theorem 2:</b>
Let $\adv$ be an adversary attacking ${\cal S}'$ 
that makes no chosen message queries but potentially many
queries to $\Hpk$. 
Then there exists an adversary $\bdv$ attacking ${\cal S}'$,
that makes only a single query to $\Hpk$, and 
whose running time is about the same as $\adv$, such that
\[  \text{SIGadv}[\adv, {\cal S}';\ 0, \qHm, \qHpk] \leq
         \qHpk \cdot \text{SIGadv}[\bdv, {\cal S}';\ 0, \qHm, 1].   \] 
</p>

<p>
<b>Proof.</b>
The proof is a simple guessing argument.  
Adversary $\bdv$ plays the role of challenger to $\adv$ and interacts
with its own challenger.  $\bdv$ relays all messages between its 
challenger and $\adv$.  
However, $\adv$ can make $\qHpk$ queries to $\Hpk$ whereas $\bdv$
can only make a single $\Hpk$ query to its challenger.
To address this, $\bdv$ will answer all of $\adv$'s queries to $\Hpk$ 
by generating random responses itself. 
In addition, $\bdv$ will choose one of $\adv$'s queries to $\Hpk$ at random
and forward it to its own challenger.  
If $\adv$ uses the arguments of that chosen query in its signature forgery,
then $\bdv$ succeeds in generating a forgery to its own challenger.
This happens with probability $1/\qHpk$, and the theorem follows.

<b>Theorem 3:</b>
Let $\adv$ be an adversary attacking ${\cal S}'$.
Then there exists an adversary $\bdv$ attacking ${\cal S}'$,
that makes no chosen message queries and
whose running time is about the same as $\adv$, such that
\begin{equation} \label{eq:final}
  \text{SIGadv}[\adv, {\cal S}';\ \qsig, \qHm, \qHpk] \leq
         (e \cdot \qsig) \cdot \text{SIGadv}[\bdv, {\cal S}';\ 0, \qHm, \qHpk]   \end{equation} 
where $e \approx 2.71$.
</p>
</div>

<p>
<b>Proof.</b>
Adversary $\bdv$ plays the role of challenger to $\adv$ and interacts
with its own challenger.  
First, $\bdv$ receives a 
public key $\PK = \big(h = g_1^\alpha,\ \hat{h} = g_0^\alpha\big)$ 
from its challenger,
which it forwards to $\adv$. 
Now, $\adv$ issues queries and $\bdv$ responds.
For $i=1,2,\ldots$, adversary $\bdv$ responds 
to query number $i$ from $\adv$ as 
follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="algbullet"> 
if the query is to $\Hpk$ then $\bdv$ forwards the query to its
challenger and forwards the response to $\adv$.</li>

<li class="algbullet"> 
if the query is for $\Hm(m_i)$ then $\bdv$ does the following:
<ol>
<li class="algbullet">
$\bdv$ generates a biased bit $b_i \in \{0,1\}$ where
$\Pr[b_i = 1] = 1/\qsig$.</li>

<li class="algbullet">
if $b_i = 1$ then $\bdv$ forwards the query to its
challenger and sends the response $\Hm(m_i)$ to $\adv$.</li>

<li class="algbullet">
if $b_i = 0$ then $\bdv$ responds 
by choosing a random $\rho_i \rgets \Z_q$
and responding to $\adv$ by setting $\Hm(m_i) \gets g_0^{\rho_i}$. </li>
</ol>
</li>

<li class="algbullet"> 
if the query is a chosen message query for message $m_i \in \MM$,
we may assume without loss of generality that $\adv$ had already issued
a query for $\Hm(m_i)$ in some previous query $j \lt i$.
If $b_j = 1$ then $\bdv$ aborts and outputs "fail".
Otherwise, we know that $\Hm(m_i) = g_0^{\rho_j}$
and $\bdv$ responds with the signature $\sigma_i = \hat{h}^{\rho_j}$,
which is a valid signature on $m_i$.  
This step is the reason we need $\hat{h}$ in the public key. 
</ul>

<p>
Suppose that $\bdv$ does not abort and that $\adv$
eventually outputs a valid forgery $(h_1, \ldots, h_n, m, \sigma)$.
The adversary must have issued a query for $\Hm(m)$,
say query number $j$. 
If $b_j = 0$ then $\bdv$ aborts and outputs "fail".
Otherwise, $\bdv$ outputs $(h_1, \ldots, h_n, m, \sigma)$ as a valid forgery.
</p>

<p>
$\bdv$ successfully answers all signature queries
with probability $(1 - 1/\qsig)^{\qsig} \geq 1/e$.
Yet $\bdv$ never issued a chosen message query to its own challenger, 
as required.
The final forgery will be accepted by $\bdv$ with probability $1/\qsig$.
Hence, $\bdv$ will output a forgery with probability at least $1/(e \qsig)$.
Moreover, when $\bdv$ outputs a forgery, the forgery is valid
with respect to the challenger's definition of $\Hm$ with 
exactly $\adv$'s forging advantage.  
Hence, 
\[   
  \text{SIGadv}[\bdv, {\cal S}';\ 0, \qHm, \qHpk] \geq
         (1/e \cdot \qsig) \cdot \text{SIGadv}[\adv, {\cal S}';\ \qsig, \qHm, \qHpk]  
\]
from which the theorem follows.

<p>
<b>Putting it all together.</b>
Putting Theorems 1,2,3 together proves security of ${\cal S}'$,
and therefore ${\cal S}$,
assuming the co-CDH assumption holds in the bilinear group $(\G_0,\G_1)$. 
Concretely, we obtain the following corollary.
</p>

<div class="theorem">
<p>
<b>Corollary:</b>
For every adversary $\adv$ attacking ${\cal S}$ there is a co-CDH 
algorithm $\bdv$, whose running time is about twice that of $\adv$,
such that 
\[   \text{SIGadv}[\adv, {\cal S}';\ \qsig, \qHm, \qHpk] \leq
          (e \qsig \qHpk) \cdot \sqrt{\epsilon} +
          (e \qsig \qHpk)/N
\]
where $N = \abs{R}$ and $\epsilon = \text{CDHadv}[\adv, (\G_0,\G_1)]$.

<h2>4. Concluding remarks</h2>

<p>
We presented a modified same-message aggregation mechanism for BLS signatures
that supports efficient verification, requiring only two pairings
to verify a multi-signature.  
The point is that security holds without requiring 
proofs of knowledge of the secret key.  
</p>

<p>
We conclude with the following remark: the proof of security for
BLS aggregation for <i>distinct</i> messages makes use of an isomorphism
$\psi: \G_1 \to \G_0$.  While in many pairing instantiations this
$\psi$ exists naturally, in some instantiations it does not.  When
$\psi$ does not exist, the proof of security still applies, but
relative to a slightly stronger assumption than co-CDH.  Specifically,
we need co-CDH to hold even if the adversary has access to an oracle
for $\psi$.  We call this the $\psi$-co-CDH assumption, and it appears
to hold whenever co-CDH holds.  Hence, BLS aggregation for
distinct messages can be safely used even when there is no efficient algorithm
to compute $\psi$.  We note that the security proof in this writeup
does not make use of $\psi$, and therefore this issue does not come up.
